Heyam Alchahin

I can say I do not have a lot of experience in coding, but I am very excited to learn about it and develop my knowledge. 
First, I am going to try my best to get as much benefit as I can from this course in order to keep up with the 
Development of this world. Also, I want to learn about Java scrip and improve my HTML and CSS dexterity. Finally, I am very exited to 
learn about the back end and see myself working and creating something beneficial and provisional.
